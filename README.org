* Setup
** [[file:projects/][./projects]] - A playground, sandbox... and actual projects
This is a weird place between super random tests and actual projects of mine. Some projects may graduate to [[id:f2122de1-b17f-485f-a1b1-d93506c3eab2][./publish]] on day, most of them won't.

Scaffold a new project with
#+begin_src bash
yarn t:template projects/good-project-name
#+end_src
** [[file:publish/][./publish]] - Own libraries/CLI tools
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f2122de1-b17f-485f-a1b1-d93506c3eab2
:END:
As the name implies, this is the land of published code consumed by other parties. So I try to put a bigger focus on comleteness in here regarding tests and documentation and principled development

Scaffold a new package with
#+begin_src bash
yarn t:template publish/good-package-name
#+end_src

* Find a project by technology
A lookup map for me
