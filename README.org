* Setup
** [[file:projects/][./projects]] - A playground and testbed
This is a place between super random tests and actual useful code snippets. Or a place to test out WIPs from imported from [[id:f2122de1-b17f-485f-a1b1-d93506c3eab2][./packages]]

Scaffold a new project with
#+begin_src bash
make-project "good-project-name"
#+end_src
** [[file:packages/][./packages]] - Own libraries/CLI tools

Scaffold a new project with
#+begin_src bash
make-package "good-package-name"
