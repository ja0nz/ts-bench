[NEW]swyx's preferred starter for Svelte projects:

- SvelteKit
- Tailwind 3 + Tailwind Typography
- Netlify

## Key Features and Design Considerations:

- Features
  - Dark mode
  - Blog with blog index
    - Top level blog URLs (`/myblog` instead of `/blog/myblog`)
    - Blog content in a separte `/content` folder instead of in `/src/routes`
  - Consumes markdown and MDSveX (and in future - external data sources)
    - with syntax highlighting
  - RSS (at `/api/rss.xml`) with caching
- Performance touches
  - no `hydrate` on about and blog pages
  - set `maxage` to 1 minute to cache (consider making it 1-7 days on older posts)
- Minor design/UX touches
  - Error page (try going to URL that doesnt exist)
  - Navlink hover effect
  - Mobile menu with animation
  - Edit on GitHub link
  - Accessible SVG Icons https://github.com/sw-yx/spark-joy/blob/master/README.md#general--misc

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

You should be able to deploy this project straight to Netlify as is, just [like this project is](https://app.netlify.com/sites/swyxkit/deploys/).

Before deploying, remember to configure `/lib/siteConfig.js` - just some hardcoded vars i want you to remember to configure.

    - Reasons it is hard to do dynamic RSS in Sveltekit:
      - Sveltekit Endpoints dont take over from Sveltekit dynamic param routes (`[slug].svelte` has precedence over `rss.xml.js`)
      - RSS Endpoint runs locally but doesnt run in Netlify bc no access to the content in prod
      - approach i went for is to use Vite's `import.meta.globEager` feature and that makes it static for the RSS...
