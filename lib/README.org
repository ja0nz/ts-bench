#+title: ~lib~

The ~/lib/~ directory contains shared code. These libraries may be deployed to package managers (e.g. npm, PyPI). They should be independent of each other. Libraries in ~/lib/~ must not be deployed as a standalone application (those are [[file:~/data/git/typescript/ts-bench/projects/][../projects]]).

* Deployed:
 - [[file:gh-cms-ql/][gh-cms-ql]] -> some GraphQL queries for used by [[file:~/data/git/typescript/ts-bench/projects/gh-cms/][gh-cms]]
